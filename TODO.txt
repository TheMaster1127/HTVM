1. Install all langs in WSL to test built-ins locally (online compilers can't handle args or file access).
2. Add the rest of the built-in functions (first GetParams func, then all the File Functions) to HTVM for the remaining languages.
3. Fix some IDE bugs and polish everything to ensure it's working as expected.
4. Ask people to try HTVM, find bugs, and provide feedback to ensure its quality before the official 2.0.0 release.
5. Set up the Discord server and a subreddit for HTVM.
6. Consider making HTVM version 2.0.0 the official release.
7. Prepare the YouTube video titled "HTVM: The Future of Programming"
8. Begin popularizing HTVM after the official release.
