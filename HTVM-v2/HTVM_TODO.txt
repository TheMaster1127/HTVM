TODO:
1. Experiment and test if the parser is flexible enough to handle "end" keywords correctly when converted.
2. Fix the place where I replace the double semicolon and remove it.
3. Remove the "end" keyword for the extra info in "for" loops. Since I've removed "for" loops, I no longer need it, but I still need to convert it to an extra "end" keyword just in case.
4. Test everything again and again to ensure it's working properly.
5. In the future, write the expression parser and implement programming blocks.
6. Make sure everything works smoothly.
