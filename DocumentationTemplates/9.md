## **Comments in HTVM**

Comments are essential for writing clear and maintainable code. They allow you to document your code without affecting how it runs. In HTVM, there are different types of comments: **Standalone Comments**, **Multi-line Comments**, **Inline Comments**, and **Comments in Programming Blocks**. Here's how each of them works:

---

### **Standalone Comments:**

**Standalone comments** are written on their own line and **will convert** properly when transforming to **other HTVM languages** or any target programming languages. These comments are perfect for leaving explanations or notes that need to be preserved across conversions.

```htvm
%%%hlepComments1%%%

```

**💡 Tip:** Standalone comments are **ideal** when you need your notes to **convert** correctly across different languages and maintain clarity for others who may work with your code.

### **Multi-line Comments:**

**Multi-line comments** are used for writing longer explanations or comments that span multiple lines. They must **always start and end on their own lines**—you cannot place extra text before or after the opening and closing markers. Inside multi-line comments, you can write as much text as you want.

```htvm
%%%hlepComments2%%%
```

#### **⚠️ Important Rules:**
- The opening of a multi-line comment **must always be on its own line**. 
- The closing of a multi-line comment **must always be on its own line**.
- **🚨 WARNING**: If you write **code** inside multi-line comments, that code **MAY get converted** during language conversion! ❗️
  - The code **won’t run**, but **it could still appear in the final code**! 
  - This means that if you have code inside multi-line comments, **be extra cautious**. If you don’t want the code to be accidentally included or converted, consider using **regular standalone comments** instead.

**💡 Tip:** If you want the code inside multi-line comments to be **preserved** and not accidentally converted during the conversion process, **use regular standalone comments** instead of multi-line comments for code explanation. **Regular standalone comments** are safer for maintaining the integrity of your code.

**⚠️ You can't use multiline comments inside a `Gui` code block.**

### **Inline Comments:**

**Inline comments** are written on the same line as your code. They’re useful for short explanations but **will disappear** when converting to **another HTVM language** or to other programming languages (e.g., **Python**, **JavaScript**, **C++**, **etc.**). This makes them **not recommended**, especially if you're working with code that will be converted, as they might carry important context that others won’t be able to see.

```htvm
%%%hlepComments3%%%
```

**⚠️ Important:** **Avoid** using inline comments whenever possible. Inline comments **will disappear** even when converting to another HTVM language. This is because they won’t be included in the converted code. If you rely on these comments for important context, it’s better to avoid using them. **Not recommended**, unless you know exactly what you’re doing, as it can lead to the loss of important information when others view or convert your code.

> *Note:* When converting code that includes Multiline Comments with commented-out code, the code will be converted into the target language as well. This ensures that even commented-out code is reflected in the converted language, making it easier for others to understand or reuse. This can be especially useful when converting to another HTVM language. For example, if someone is reading your code and has converted it to their own HTVM language, any commented-out code will be converted into their language, allowing them to read and understand what you intended to comment out. But only inside multiline comments will the code be converted into the target language.
>
> Regular Standalone Comments will also be converted, but only the comment keyword will be converted—nothing inside them will be converted. Only code inside Multiline Comments will be converted into the target language.
>
> But don’t worry, that code will not run because it’s just text, though it will be converted. This means you can use Multiline Comments to explain something without needing to include any code. Just plain text will work as well.

### **Comments in Programming Blocks:**

**Comments in programming blocks** must use the correct syntax for the target language. This is a **must**, not a best practice. You have to use the correct comment syntax based on the target language (e.g., **Python**, **JavaScript**, **C++**, **etc.**) inside their respective programming blocks.

```py
# This is a Python comment inside a Python programming block.
```

**⚠️ Important:** When working with **programming blocks**, make sure that you use the correct comment **syntax for that programming block language**. Otherwise, you may encounter issues in the code. Make sure you know which **characters** or **keywords** are used for comments in that language (for example, **#** for Python or **//** for JavaScript) to avoid mistakes.
