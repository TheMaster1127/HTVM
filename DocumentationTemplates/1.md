1. [Introduction](#introduction-to-htvm)  
Understand why HTVM is the future of programming.

2. [OSP (Ordinal Struct Programming)](#osp-ordinal-struct-programming)  
Learn about OSP (Ordinal Struct Programming) a new way to use Structs.

3. [How Your Language Looks Like](#how-your-language-looks-like)  
Get to know how HTVM code is structured and its syntax style.

4. [Programming Blocks](#programming-blocks)  
HTVM introduces **programming blocks** that allow you to code in the target language seamlessly in your code. This feature is designed to handle cases where HTVM itself can't achieve something directly or when you'd prefer to rely on another language for specific tasks.

5. [Variables](#variables)  
Learn how to declare and use variables in HTVM for storing and manipulating data.

6. [Functions](#functions)  
Explore how to define and use functions for modular and reusable code.

7. [Pattern Matching](#pattern-matching)  
HTVM provides a flexible and minimalist `when` block for pattern matching. It is designed to be highly intuitive, allowing you to write complex conditional logic with the least possible syntax and elegantly eliminating the verbosity of traditional `if-else` chains.

8. [Liner](#liner)  
The `Liner` construct is a unique and powerful feature in HTVM designed for evaluating a series of boolean conditions in a clean, readable block.

9. [Arrays](#arrays)  
Dive into working with arrays, one of the most essential data structures in HTVM.

10. [Loops](#loops)  
Master the looping structures available in HTVM, such as the standard loop and infinite loops.

11. [Comments](#comments)  
Add clarity to your code by using comments to document and explain your code.

12. [GUI (Graphical User Interface with HTVM)](#gui-graphical-user-interface-with-htvm)  
Learn how to the GUI feature in HTVM that allows for the creation of graphical user interfaces specifically for **web browsers (JavaScript)**.

13. [Backend in HTVM](#backend-in-htvm)  
Learn how to use HTVM's Backend functionality that generates **Python** code using **Flask**.

14. [Error Handling](#error-handling)  
Understand how to manage errors and handle exceptions in HTVM to make your programs more robust.

15. [Include](#include)  
Discover how to include external files and resources in your HTVM project for enhanced functionality.

16. [Commands](#commands)  
Commands in HTVM are a simplified way to perform actions, similar to functions, but with a more compact, direct, and concise syntax for better efficiency.

17. [All Syntax](#all-syntax)  
This is all of your syntax.

18. [Built-in Functions](#built-in-functions)  
Explore the wide range of built-in functions categorized for ease of use.
