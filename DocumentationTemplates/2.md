### Advanced String Features

HTVM supports powerful string definition methods, including formatted strings (f-strings) and multiline strings for easier text handling.

*   **F-Strings (`f"..."`)**: Allow embedding variables and expressions directly within strings.
*   **Multiline Strings (`mls`...`mle`)**: Define strings that span multiple lines, preserving formatting (like newlines and indentation) exactly as written. Ideal for raw text, templates, or ASCII art.
*   **Multiline F-Strings (`fmls`...`mle`)**: Combine the benefits of multiline strings and f-strings, allowing embedded variables and expressions within a multiline block.

Here's how you can use them:

```htvm
%%%htvmSnippet100%%%

```

#### Summary: The Power of Advanced Strings

These advanced string features (`f`, `mls`, `fmls`) significantly enhance HTVM's usability and power. They eliminate the need for cumbersome string concatenation and complex formatting logic.

*   **Readability**: Code becomes much cleaner and easier to read, especially when dealing with templates, long text blocks, or dynamic content generation.
*   **Simplicity**: Constructing complex strings with embedded variables or preserving exact formatting is now straightforward and intuitive.
*   **Expressiveness**: HTVM becomes even more expressive, allowing you to focus on the logic rather than wrestling with string manipulation quirks.

This level of string handling flexibility is a testament to HTVM's design philosophy: providing powerful, convenient tools that adapt to the programmer's needs, ultimately making development faster and more enjoyable. It's another step towards making HTVM the future of simplified, yet powerful, programming.
