# HTVM

## HTVM: The Adaptive, Multi-Language, Customizable Syntax and Code Generation Engine

HTVM is a powerful engine that converts code to 15 languages, including C++, Python, JavaScript, and more (see langs.txt for the full list). It offers extreme customizability in syntax and code generation, along with a built-in IDE.

!!! HTVM IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT !!!

Alright, let's make this crystal clear.  

### **What HTVM Is NOT**  
HTVM is **not** a general-purpose transpiler that lets you convert between existing languages. You **cannot** use HTVM to convert Python to JavaScript, JavaScript to C++, or any other combination like that. If you have a Python script and want to turn it into JavaScript, **HTVM is not what you're looking for.**  

Similarly, you **cannot** take existing code from languages like Python, Java, or C# and convert it to HTVM. That’s simply not how HTVM works. **HTVM is its own thing**—it’s a language that has its own syntax, which can be customized to your liking, and that syntax is what gets converted into other languages.  

However, what **is** possible is converting **HTVM to HTVM**—meaning, you can have different custom syntaxes within HTVM and convert between them. That’s something no other system really does. But again, **HTVM does not translate between standard programming languages—it only translates its own customizable syntax to these languages.**

### **What HTVM Actually Is**  
HTVM is **a revolutionary, next-level programming system** that lets you define your own syntax and then convert that syntax into **fifteen different programming languages**:  

**C++, Python, JavaScript, Go, Lua, C#, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Nim, AutoHotKey, Swift, Dart, TypeScript, and Groovy.**  

It’s not just a transpiler—it’s an entire **ecosystem** that allows you to **create your own language, structure it however you want, and then generate real-world code in multiple target languages.**  

But here’s where it gets insane: **HTVM is not locked into any one syntax.** You can **completely customize** how your code looks. 

### **Total Syntax Customization – The Ultimate Flexibility**  

HTVM **isn’t just about converting your custom language to multiple targets—it’s about letting you build your language exactly the way you want.** And when I say customizable, I mean **everything** is customizable:  

#### **1. Customize Every Keyword and Operator**  
- Want to rename `if` to `when`? Go for it.  
- Prefer `func` instead of `function`? No problem.  
- Don’t like `+`? You can replace it with `plus` as a word. (Though be careful if you have a variable named `plus`—but you get the idea.)  
- Even assignment operators can be customized, and some can even support **multiple-word replacements!**  

#### **2. Change Code Structure – Your Rules, Your Style**  
- You can **switch between bracket styles**—curly braces `{}` can be replaced with other characters, words, or even removed entirely.  
- **Want Python-like indentation instead of brackets?** Just toggle it on.  
- You can enable or disable **semicolon usage**—if you like them, keep them. If you don’t, get rid of them.  
- Parentheses around `if` conditions? **Optional.** You can toggle whether `if (condition)` requires parentheses or not.  

#### **3. Lua-Style `end` or Custom Keywords**  
- You can replace curly braces `{}` with a Lua-style `end` keyword.  
- Even better? **You can rename `end` to anything**—`stop`, `done`, `finish`, whatever you like.  
- **Single-word or multiple-word custom keywords?** Both are possible.  

#### **4. Escape Characters, Bitwise Operators, and More**  
- You can **customize the escape character**—no longer limited to `\`.  
- Even **bitwise operators can be modified**—something you rarely see in any language.  

#### **5. Array & Typing Style – Your Choice**  
- Want arrays to use `{}` instead of `[]`? Or even `()`? That’s up to you.  
- Do you prefer **TypeScript-style typing** (`variable: type`) or **C-style** (`type variable`)? You can choose **whichever feels more natural to you.**  

#### **6. And Many More...**  
- Go to [HTVM's website](https://themaster1127.github.io/HTVM) (**STILL IN DEVELOPMENT—don’t go there yet, come back another day!** But you can still check the progress of the website.) to explore all the syntax customizability and create your own language.  
- Visit [The HTVM Web IDE](https://themaster1127.github.io/HTVM/src-website/online-ide.html?id=1) (**STILL IN DEVELOPMENT—don’t go there yet, come back another day!** But you can still check the progress.) First, go to the main website, then you can get redirected to the IDE to use it with your own language. HTVM can also be run **locally** by first compiling `HTVM.cpp`, and you can use the **HTVM IDE** as well. (**Docs are coming soon!**)  

### **The Power of HTVM – Beyond Anything Else**  
This isn’t just some hobby project. **HTVM Version 2 took over three months just for the parser.** And that was with prior experience from HTVM Version 1 and all the work put into previous languages like HT++, HTH, and HTpy. Every single language had to be carefully mapped out—loops, if-statements, try/catch blocks, functions, variables, types—**every detail had to be considered, tested, and tweaked.**  

And here’s the thing: **HTVM doesn’t just output to one language at a time—it can compile to multiple languages simultaneously.** That means you can write a single HTVM file and have it generate both JavaScript and Python code at the same time. That alone is something **almost no other tool in the world can do.**

### **Programming Blocks – Total Control Over Your Code**  
And then we have **Programming Blocks.** These allow you to **write native code for the target language directly inside HTVM files**. So if you’re converting to JavaScript and need something that HTVM doesn’t handle natively, you can just open a **JavaScript Programming Block**, write JavaScript inside it, and it will only be included when compiling to JavaScript.  

But it gets even crazier—**you can have multiple programming blocks for different languages in the same file.** That means you can mix HTVM, JavaScript, Python, and C++ **all in one place** and still have everything work correctly.  

And if that wasn’t enough, there are **Reverse Programming Blocks**—which allow for even more insane levels of customization. Even if nobody uses them, **HTVM is so complete that the feature is still there.**

### **The Future of Programming**  
HTVM **isn’t just a transpiler—it’s the future of programming.**  

This is a system that allows **anyone** to create their own syntax, define how they want their language to behave, and then generate fully functional code in fifteen different programming languages. No more being stuck with a single syntax or workflow—**HTVM lets you build programming your way.**  

Think about it. If you had to manually convert HTVM to fifteen different languages, it would take months just for a single feature. But **HTVM automates that entire process**—**once your syntax is defined, your language works across all targets instantly.**  

### **HTVM – The Future of Programming**  
This level of customization **doesn’t exist anywhere else.** No other system gives you this much control over how your language looks and feels. You’re not just writing code—you’re **designing your own programming experience.**  

HTVM isn’t just powerful—it’s **insane.** This is how programming should be.

**HTVM doesn’t force you into a fixed way of coding—it lets you create your own language and then outputs it into real programming languages.**

HTVM **isn’t just another programming tool. It’s a revolution.**
